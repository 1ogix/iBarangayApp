# BrgyGo Platform Monorepo

This repository groups the barangay services application into dedicated `FRONTEND` and `BACKEND` workspaces.

- `FRONTEND/` – Next.js 14 app router project using shadcn/ui and Supabase auth helpers. Includes the landing page, login screen, and placeholder citizen/admin portals.
- `BACKEND/` – Supabase infrastructure scaffold. Initialize the Supabase CLI here to manage database migrations, edge functions, and automation scripts.

See `FRONTEND/README.md` and `BACKEND/README.md` for setup steps in each workspace.
